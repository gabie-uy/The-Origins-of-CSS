# The Origins II: CSS

## Rule Syntax
*01_Picasso*

**Rules** â€“ How the elements should be styled on our page

Every rule begins with a **selector**, followed by curly brackets ``{ }``

**Declarations** are made of ``property:value`` pairs separated by a colon. Each line ends with a ``;`` semicolon.

## Selectors (part 1)
*02_Syntax*

### Type Selectors
Which selects all matching elements on the page for styling

    div {
        /* Styles go here. */
    }

### Class and ID Selectors
The following example selects elements with a ``class`` of ``"class-name"`` or an ``id`` of ``"id-name"``:

    .class-name {
        /* Styles go here. */
    }

    #id-name {
        /* Styles go here. */
    }

- Selecting by class is done with a ``.`` period, and used to style multiple elements with a matching class attribute.
- Selecting by id is done with a ``#`` hashtag, and used to style a single element with a matching id attribute.

        div.class-name {
            /* Styles go here. */
        }

        div#id-name {
            /* Styles go here. */
        }

Rather than selecting every element with a matching class or id, the example above selects only div elements that either have a class of ``"class-name"`` or an id of ``"id-name"``.

This specific kind of selection is also known as **targeting**.
